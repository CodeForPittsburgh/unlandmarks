    <h2>About</h2>
    <h2>Our application:</h2>
    <p>
        Pittsburghers have serious respect for their city’s history. Many of them are also long-term residents of their particular neighborhoods, and proud of the many local businesses and monuments that once existed in their surround. We are a city in many ways haunted by the past, and you can see in the physical grid of the city the spaces where great engines of industry once stood. Newcomers get lost in our city. It isn’t easy to give them directions. Three rights never make a left. The waypoints described are often long-gone, making the directions useless to someone who is new in town. It’s a friction point - a split between the city’s newer residents and those who have lived here for decades. But it isn’t - it is endearing and it cements the knowledge of what came before into the memories of a new group of residents. It means neighbors talk to neighbors, and that’s always good in this town.
