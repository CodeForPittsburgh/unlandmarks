The Syria Mosque was originally built as the new home of the Pittsburgh Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. Construction began in 1911 and the building was dedicated on October 26, 1916. The 3,700-seat, ornate, faux-Middle Eastern-style building was the center of Pittsburgh's music culture for 75 years, hosting internationally renowed classical, jazz, rock, opera, and dance performers. It was the home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the May Beegle Concert series, the Pittsburgh Opera, and the National Negro Opera Company.
The Syria Mosque also hosted speeches by U.S. presidents and presidential candidates including Harry S. Truman, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and Pittsburgh mayor David L. Lawrence.
The DuMont Television Network (later KDKA-TV) hosted the first network television broadcast from Syria Mosque on January 11, 1949.
The last concert at the Syria Mosque was in May 1991. The building was demolished amid controversy on August 27, 1991.
